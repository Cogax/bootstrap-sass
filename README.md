# Bootstrap for Sass
`bootstrap-sass` is a Sass-powered version of [Bootstrap](http://github
.com/twbs/bootstrap), ready to drop right into your Sass powered applications
. This is a extended version!

## Extended
This version is a fork of the official Sass port of Twitter Bootstrap. It 
contains some changes on the Button mixins.

### Buttons
* mixin `button()` defines a simple button. Equivalent to the `.btn` class.
* mixin `button-style($variant: default)` defines a button-style. Equivalent 
to the `.btn-default .btn-primary .btn-success .btn-info .btn-waring 
.btn-danger` classes.
